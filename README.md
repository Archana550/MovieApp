# Movie Browser

## Description
A movie-browsing web application that allows users to search for movies, apply filters, and save their favorite movies.

## Features
- Search movies by title
- Infinite scrolling
- Advanced filtering options (optional)
- Save favorite movies locally
- Responsive design
- Accessible and SEO-friendly

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movie-browser
   npm init
   ```

## Functional Requirements
- Use a modern frontend framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) to build the application to create a responsive, mobile-first UI.

- Use a public movie API (e.g., IMDb API, TMDB API) to fetch movie data.

- Display a list of movies on the homepage, including the movie title, poster image, and release year.

- Implement a search feature that allows users to search for movies by title. The search should fetch and update the list of movies dynamically as the user types.

- Implement infinite scrolling to handle large numbers of search results. Extra points if you donâ€™t use a third-party solution.


- Allow users to save their favorite movies. Favorite movies should be stored locally (e.g., using browser storage). 

- Ensure the application is SEO-friendly and accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility best practices.

- Write clean, well-structured code following best practices

- Provide documentation explaining how to run the application, your design decisions, and any additional features implemented. Also, mention any possible improvements in your implementation
